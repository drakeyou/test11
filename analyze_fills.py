"""Position-level PnL for the target wallets.

    node src/pm/resolve.mjs --from target-fills.csv    # first, to get outcomes
    python3 analyze_fills.py

Joins target-fills.csv to pm-resolutions.csv and reports what each position
actually returned. The join is on asset_id, which is the resolution file's
token_id: a position is one outcome token, and its fate is that token's payout.

The point of the resolution join is that most positions are never sold. Without
knowing whether an unsold position expired worthless or was redeemed at a
dollar, return can only be measured on the ones that sold — which is
survivorship bias, and makes any strategy look profitable.

Standard library only.
