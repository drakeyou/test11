DESCRIPTION = """# Polymarket / gg.bet collection extract

Collected by the repository this file came from. {days} day-file(s): {files}.

Sweeps in this extract span {span}. That is the range of the *sample*; see
`sweeps-strata.csv` for how many significant sweeps each day actually held.
Sample per day (exported/significant): {strata}

The raw store is a few gigabytes, almost all of it order-book snapshots. This
extract keeps what analysis needs and drops the bulk.

## What is here

{contents}

## How to read sweeps.csv

One row per detected collapse of the bid side: {sweeps} rows, sampled from
{significant} that passed the significance filter. Median `bid_after`:
{median_after}. Rule counts: {rules}

The columns below are read off the file this run wrote, not off a description
kept beside it. A column that exists and is not explained here says so in its
own row.

{sweep_columns}

### The three groups that matter

- **The capacity question** — `prior_size_at_00X`, `prior_depth_bid_total`.
  How much of someone else's money already stands in the queue at the price
  the strategy bids at.
- **The value question** — `fair_lower_bound`, `paired_ask_size`, `book_sum`,
  `paired_stale_seconds`. Whether the token was left below what the other half
  of its own market says it is worth, how much size backs that claim, and
  whether the book making it was live. `book_sum` near zero voids the rest of
  the row: both sides were empty.
- **The outcome question** — `high_*`, `resolved_before_*`, `book_frozen`. What
  the bid did next, and whether there was a market left for it to do it in.
  A frozen book and a book nobody bid into look identical without that flag.

## How to read book-series.csv

The same quantities as `sweeps.csv`, as a series rather than a single instant:
one snapshot every thirty seconds from five minutes before each collapse to
fifteen minutes after. A row of `sweeps.csv` cannot show a recovery taking
shape; this can. Only the deepest few hundred sweeps get one, because the book
table is heartbeated every five seconds per token and a full export of it is
the thing this bundle exists to avoid.

{series_columns}

## How to read fill-context.csv

One row per fill by a studied wallet, assembled from the stored snapshots after
the horizons around it had passed.

{fill_columns}

## How to read markets.csv

- `game_start_time` — when the match started. The subscription window is built
  on it; `end_date` is a resolution deadline (game + 6h for CS2, game + a week
  for tennis) and dates nothing.
- `subscribed_at` / `unsubscribed_at` / `release_reason` — when the book was
  watched, and why watching stopped: `resolved`, `past the hold window`, or
  `window passed unwatched` (the market was first seen after its match).
- `observed_during_game` — 1 when book snapshots exist inside the match itself.
  This is the self-check: rows with 0 were never watched in play, and nothing
  measured on them describes what happened during the match.

## Caveats that matter

- A book *swept* to two cents and a book *resting* at two cents are different
  events; only the first is an opportunity, and `report.txt` reports them
  separately.
- `fair_lower_bound` is a bound, not a price. It says the token cannot be worth
  less than that if the twin's ask is real; it does not say anyone will pay it.
  `paired_ask_size` is how seriously to take it.
- `ggbet_fair` and `dislocation_ratio` are null wherever the market could not be
  matched to gg.bet, which is the great majority of rows. They are kept for
  continuity with earlier extracts; the twin-token columns answer the same
  question without an external feed.
- `resolved_before_*` is filled from resolutions the collector learned about,
  and the CLOB reports those late. A market that settled during the horizon can
  still read 0. `book_frozen` is the signal that does not depend on that.
- Tick size is per market: mostly 0.01, sometimes 0.001. A three-tick move is
  not a fixed number of cents.
- Coverage is counted from heartbeats. Hours with fewer than expected are
  incomplete, and dividing by them overstates any rate.
- `fills-report.txt` separates five exit modes. A position sold in part and
  left to resolve is neither sold nor held: it carries both proceeds and a
  payout, and pooling it with either corrupts that group's hit rate.
- A position with no buys means its purchases happened before collection
  started. Its size is a lower bound, and it is listed in
  `pm-position-gaps.csv` rather than silently averaged in.
- `universe-summary.csv` is what separates "the bot never traded here" from "the
  logger never looked here". It only runs forward: markets seen before the
  journal existed are not in it, so a sample drawn from before that point still
  describes a slice of unknown origin.
