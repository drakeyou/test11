//   - the first frame after subscribing is an ARRAY of `book` snapshots, one per
//     asset; every later frame is a single OBJECT
//   - `book` is a full replacement, resent periodically, which resyncs us
//   - `price_change` carries { asset_id, price, size, side } where `size` is the
//     NEW resting size at that price, not a delta; zero removes the level
//   - `last_trade_price` is a print, not a book event
//
// Prices are keyed as integer thousandths so "0.1" and "0.10" cannot become two
// different levels.

 * price, so the market is not pricing b above it — which puts a floor under a:
 *
 *     P(a) = 1 - P(b) >= 1 - ask_b
 *
 * That floor is the point. When the bid on a has been swept to a cent and the
 * twin's ask still says a is worth at least fifteen, the dislocation is derived
 * from resting orders rather than guessed at, and no outside price feed is
 * involved. Both tokens are already subscribed and both books are already in
 * memory, so this costs a map lookup.
 *
 * The floor is only as good as the offer behind it: a lone share offered at
 * 0.99 implies a floor of 0.01 and means nothing, hence `askSize`. And an offer
 * nobody has refreshed in minutes is not evidence about now, hence
 * `staleSeconds` — measured from the book's last real change, not from the last
