// Module D — the book around a fill by a studied wallet.
//
// This is the ground truth the whole collection exists for. Everything else —
// the subscription window, the sweep detector, the twin token — is there so
// that when one of the wallets is filled at two cents, the state of the book on
// either side of that moment is on record.
//
// It has to be assembled afterwards. A fill is not an event we receive: it is
// found by polling the trade log tens of seconds later, and the fifteen minutes
// after it have not happened yet. So the fill is queued and written up once its
// horizons have passed, out of snapshots already stored — the same shape as the
// sweep horizons, and for the same reason.
//
// `snapshot_available` is the column that keeps this honest. A row of nulls
// because the market was never watched and a row of nulls because the book was
// empty are different findings, and without the flag they read the same.
